# :bird: Totally Not Flappy Bird

A totally legally distinct game made in unity about a bird flapping and falling between two legally distinct pipes.

## :keyboard: How to use

- Tap space to flap :flight_departure:
- Flex your highscore :muscle:
- Enjoy the most well crafted sound effects :notes:

## :camera_flash: Caught in (almost) 4K
This was my first dabble with Unity to familiarize myself with the interface
